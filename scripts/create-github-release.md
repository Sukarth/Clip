# GitHub Release Creation Guide

This guide will help you create the GitHub release for Clip v1.0.0-beta.

## Prerequisites

1. **Repository Setup**: Make sure you have a GitHub repository created
2. **Built Files**: Run the release preparation script first
3. **Git Remote**: Ensure your local repository is connected to GitHub

## Step-by-Step Release Process

### 1. Push to GitHub

First, make sure all changes are pushed to GitHub:

```bash
# Add remote if not already added
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sukarth/Clip.git

# Push the Dev branch
git push -u origin Dev

# Create and push main branch from Dev
git checkout -b main
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Build Release Files

Run the release preparation script:

```bash
node scripts/prepare-release.js
```

This will create the distribution files in the `dist/` directory.

   - `latest.yml` (Update metadata)

5. **Release Options**
   - âœ… Check "This is a pre-release" (since it's beta)
